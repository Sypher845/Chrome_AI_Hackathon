# Requirements Document

## Introduction

The Smart Context Generator is a Chrome extension designed to optimize prompts for Large Language Models (LLMs) by intelligently gathering and organizing contextual information. The extension maintains session-based context across browser tabs within a window, allowing users to work on specific issues while seamlessly switching between different web applications (ChatGPT, documentation, etc.). The system captures information through file uploads, screenshots, and active tab content, then uses AI to determine if additional web research is needed before generating an optimized prompt.

## Glossary

- **Extension**: The Smart Context Generator Chrome extension
- **Session**: A persistent context container associated with a specific issue or task, maintained across all tabs in the current browser window
- **Context**: Information collected for a session, including user input, uploaded files, screenshots, and captured tab content
- **Active Tab**: The currently visible browser tab in the Chrome window
- **Optimization Flow**: The process of analyzing gathered context and generating an optimized prompt through API calls
- **Sufficiency Check**: An API call that determines whether existing context is adequate for prompt optimization
- **Web Research**: Automated web searches performed to gather additional information when context is insufficient
- **Popup UI**: The compact extension interface accessible via the browser toolbar icon for quick access
- **Extension Page**: A dedicated full HTML page within the extension providing comprehensive management of sessions and context
- **Window Scope**: The boundary within which a session persists (all tabs in a single Chrome window)
- **Task/Issue ID**: A unique identifier for each work session that remains consistent across all tabs in the window
- **Extract Tabs Functionality**: A feature that allows users to manually capture and add context from the Active Tab to the current Task/Issue ID

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a developer working on an issue, I want to create and manage sessions for different tasks, so that I can maintain organized context for each problem I'm solving.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the user opens the Extension popup, THE Extension SHALL display an interface to create a new session or select an existing session
2. WHEN the user creates a new session, THE Extension SHALL assign a unique identifier to that session and associate it with the current Chrome window
3. WHILE a session is active in a Chrome window, THE Extension SHALL maintain that session's context across all tabs within that window
4. WHEN the user switches between tabs in the same window, THE Extension SHALL preserve the active session and its accumulated context
5. WHEN the user closes all tabs in a window, THE Extension SHALL persist the session data for future retrieval

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a user, I want to manually add different types of content to my task/issue context through the extract tabs functionality, so that I can build comprehensive information for prompt optimization.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the user clicks the file upload option, THE Extension SHALL allow the user to select one or more files from their local system and associate them with the current Task/Issue ID
2. WHEN files are uploaded, THE Extension SHALL extract the file content and add it to the current Task/Issue ID's context
3. WHEN the user clicks the screenshot option, THE Extension SHALL capture a visual snapshot of the Active Tab and add it to the Task/Issue ID's context
4. WHEN the user clicks the extract tab context option, THE Extension SHALL extract the textual content from the Active Tab and add it to the Task/Issue ID's context
5. WHILE the user switches between tabs in the same window, THE Extension SHALL maintain all context items under the same Task/Issue ID
6. THE Extension SHALL display all captured context items (files, screenshots, tab content) associated with the current Task/Issue ID with the ability to review or remove them

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a user, I want to input my initial prompt or task description, so that the system has a baseline understanding of what I'm trying to accomplish.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. THE Extension SHALL provide a text input area in the popup for the user to enter their initial prompt or task description
2. WHEN the user enters text in the prompt area, THE Extension SHALL store this as part of the session context
3. THE Extension SHALL allow the user to edit their initial prompt at any time before optimization
4. WHEN the user has entered a prompt, THE Extension SHALL enable the "Optimize Context" button

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a user, I want the system to automatically determine if my context is sufficient based on my task/issue and all gathered data, so that I don't waste time gathering unnecessary information.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the user clicks "Optimize Context", THE Extension SHALL send both the original task/issue description and all accumulated context data to a Sufficiency Check API endpoint
2. THE Sufficiency Check API SHALL analyze the combined information (task/issue + gathered context) and determine the extent of web research needed
3. IF the Sufficiency Check determines the context is sufficient, THEN THE Extension SHALL proceed directly to the optimization API call
4. IF the Sufficiency Check determines the context is insufficient, THEN THE Extension SHALL determine the scope of Web Research needed and proceed to that flow
5. THE Extension SHALL display a loading indicator to the user while the Sufficiency Check is in progress

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a user, I want the system to automatically gather additional information when needed, so that my optimized prompt has all necessary context without manual research.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the Sufficiency Check determines context is insufficient, THE Extension SHALL initiate Web Research API calls to gather additional information
2. THE Extension SHALL perform multiple web searches based on the initial prompt and existing context to find relevant information
3. WHEN Web Research is complete, THE Extension SHALL compile the gathered information with the existing context
4. THE Extension SHALL display a summary of the additional information gathered to the user
5. AFTER Web Research completion, THE Extension SHALL proceed to the final optimization API call

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a user, I want to receive an optimized version of my prompt with all relevant context, so that I can get better responses from LLMs.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the optimization flow reaches the final stage, THE Extension SHALL send all compiled context to an optimization API endpoint with specific system instructions
2. THE optimization API SHALL generate an enhanced prompt that incorporates all relevant context in a structured format
3. WHEN the optimized prompt is received, THE Extension SHALL display it to the user in a copyable format
4. THE Extension SHALL provide a "Copy to Clipboard" button that copies the optimized prompt when clicked
5. THE Extension SHALL save the optimized prompt as part of the session history for future reference

### Requirement 7

**User Story:** As a user, I want the extension to work seamlessly across different tabs and websites, so that I can gather context from multiple sources while working on my issue.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHILE a session is active, THE Extension SHALL allow context capture from any tab within the current window
2. WHEN the user switches to a documentation page, THE Extension SHALL enable capturing that page's content as context
3. WHEN the user switches to a chat interface (like ChatGPT), THE Extension SHALL maintain the session context without loss
4. THE Extension SHALL display the current session name or identifier in the popup regardless of which tab is active
5. WHEN the user opens a new tab in the same window, THE Extension SHALL automatically associate that tab with the active session

### Requirement 8

**User Story:** As a user, I want to see the status of the optimization process, so that I understand what the system is doing and can track progress.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN an optimization process begins, THE Extension SHALL display the current stage (Sufficiency Check, Web Research, or Final Optimization)
2. WHILE Web Research is in progress, THE Extension SHALL display the number of searches completed and remaining
3. IF an API call fails, THEN THE Extension SHALL display a clear error message to the user with retry options
4. WHEN the optimization is complete, THE Extension SHALL display a success message with the time taken
